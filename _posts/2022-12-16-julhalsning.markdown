_(Läs som Julaftonsnatt/Twas the Night Before Christmas)_

Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the land\
The healthcare system was working, with doctors on hand\
To tend to the sick, and to make them feel fine\
Using their skills, and the latest in technology, online

<!--more-->

The nurses were busy, with patients to see\
Using electronic records, to keep track of their key\
Vitals and stats, and to make sure they're okay\
Thanks to the power of health IT, in every way

The hospitals hummed, with machines all around\
Monitoring patients, with sensors and sound\
Tracking their progress, and making sure they heal\
All thanks to the marvels, of modern healthcare steel

So here's to the doctors, the nurses, and all those who care\
For the health of the nation, and the well-being they share\
May their work be rewarded, and their efforts not go unseen\
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good healthcare dream!
